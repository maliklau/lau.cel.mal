      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>This component simulates an acoustic piano using samples. This piano supports all 88 keys that are on a standard piano. This piano has the ability to play more than one note at a time. It also simulates a sustain pedal, which allows notes to sustain for their full duration. When the pedal is pressed, a sound effect for pressing the pedal itself is played to make it more authentic. There are two forms of dynamics that were implemented. There is amplitude which is the volume of the note that is being played. The other is velocity, which is how hard or soft a key is pressed. To implement velocity, two different samples (soft and loud) are interpolated to simulate the dynamics of the piano. An envelope with attack, decay, sustain, and release was created as well.</p>

      <h3>Attributes for the score file:</h3>
      <p>a: sets the amplitude (volume) velocity: How hard a key is pressed <br>
        pedal: 0=Pedal released, 1=Pedal pressed <br>
        attack: sets the attack part of the envelope <br>
        release: sets the release part of the envelope <br>
        decay: sets the decay part of the envelope <br>
        sustain:  sets the sustain part of the envelope</p>

      <h3>Grading criteria:</h3>
      <p>10 - Plays piano notes <br>
        20 - Envelope generation  <br>
        30 - Pedal simulation <br>
        35 - Basic dynamics <br>

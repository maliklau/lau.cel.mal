      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>This portion of the project required me to find some wav files of drums. Take those files and play them back through a wave table.  While doing this, I am able to take their original pitch and raise or lower it, I am able to make any drum play at any time and even play two or more drums at the same time.  The other big part was I synthesized my own drum using a sine wave. This is all done through a drum instrument file, a drum factory, and a drum envelope. They all work together to load the files into a wave table and then I can freely play them back as I wish.  In order to play the drums from an xml file, I mapped each drum to a note. That way, when the xml calls that note, it really calls that drum, so for example, when I call C2, I play a snare drum. You can see the xml format below.</p>

      <h3>Attributes for the score file:</h3>
      <p>measure: the measure we are playing in <br>
        beat: the beat of the measure we begin the note <br>
        note: which drum is playing <br>
        pitch: changes the pitch of the drum

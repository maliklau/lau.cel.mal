      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>This component accepts audio from the other components and applies effects, producing the final output of the system. The implemented effects are chorus, flanging, compression, and noise gate. A chorus effect occurs when individual sounds with similar pitch converge and are perceived as one. A flanging effect is produced by mixing two identical signals together, with one signal delayed by a small and gradually changing period. A compression effect is an operation that attenuates signals above a threshold. A noise gate effect is an operation that attenuates signals below a threshold.
      This effects component allows for controllable sends, meaning that you can control the mixture of dry (input) and wet (output) for every effect and every audio source. As a result, you can apply no effects to a sound, and apply 3 effects to another sound much like a professional mixing system.</p>

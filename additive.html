      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>The Additive Synthesis instrument is created my generating multiple sin waves and
      adding them up into a sample to be written to a channel. The harmonics are created
    by changing the amplitude and freqency during the generation of the sine waves. Polyphony allows
    for multiple notes to be played at a time (chords). Sound cross fading is calculated to have the notes
    smoothly transition from one to anotherl, this is done by interpolation. The generated envelope uses attack and
    release to make the notes have a smoother transition with less abrupt changes which cause a pop sound. I used
    a separate attack and release class called CAR to implement this.
    The vibrato it implemented thorugh varying pitch. I referenced Lecture 4 notes to calculate the
    radians and then add them to the frame (channel).</p>

      <h3>Attributes for the score file:</h3>
      <p>harmonics: a string of harmonics to be generated <br>
        vibfreq: the frequency for the virbrato to be played <br>
        vibmult: the multiplier for the vibrato to change the pitch by a percent <br>
        cross: to see if cross fading should occurr <br>
        crossval: the value used to calculate cross cross-fading <br>
        note: the note/pitch specified
      </p>

      <h3>Grading criteria:</h3>
      <p>10 - Sinusoid playback on demand from the sequencer: a sound is generated and played by the sequencer 10<br>
        20 - Definition of all harmonics: generate multiple sine waves and add them to a sample, changing freq and amp 20<br>
        30 -  Envelope generation: uses attack and release to smooth note sounds 30<br>
        35 -  Polyphony: multiple notes play at a time 35<br>
        40 -  Sound cross-fading: notes cross fade in and out due to calculation 40<br>
        50 - Vibrato OR glissando: radians are calculated to chagne pitch for vibrato 50</p>
